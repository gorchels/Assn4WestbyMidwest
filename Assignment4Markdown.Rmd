lob_ab = read_csv("lobster_size_abundance.csv")

```

# "Compare mean lobster size by site in 2017"

Note: We will need to get lob_ab into tidyformet (still working on it), meanwhile the code can be set up in preperation

```{r}
lob_size_2017 <- select(lob_ab, YEAR, SITE, SIZE) %>%  # Select relevant categories. Note, depending on how the we make the file tidy, the first term may need to change 
  filter(YEAR == "2017") %>% 
  group_by(SITE)
```
